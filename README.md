# EDIPI-qgs-tutorial-on-predictability

This series of notebooks are part of a tutorial given during the EDIPI workshop at RMI in January 2023.
In this tutorial, you will learn:

1. How to install [qgs](https://github.com/Climdyn/qgs)
2. How to run the model
3. How to compute the largest Lyapunov exponent in the model
4. How to compute the full Lyapunov exponent spectrum
5. How to compute the correlation properties of the underlying dynamical model

## Installation

First, clone the current repository:

  git clone git@github.com:jodemaey/EDIPI-qgs-tutorial-on-predictability.git

Then, to install qgs, clone the qgs repository

  git clone https://github.com/Climdyn/qgs.git

and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Climdyn/qgs#installation). 
After that, you can the tutorial notebooks in `EDIPI-qgs-tutorial-on-predictability` in the `qgs` folder and you are ready.
Simply start the notebook server in the `qgs` folder and type:
